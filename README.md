# Health_bot
A bot that can be deployed in any leading platform to help medical staff in COVID-19 situations

Due to the situation of COVID-19 the work force of the world is decreasing(since everyone is maintaining self quarantine and social distancing ), which is creating a big havoc in the world, through this project of mine, I mainly target to tackle this problem and help the health organizations with a virtual workforce that runs 24*7 without any break, and handles all kind of mater, starting from guiding the people to fill up the forms to managing the data of the patients automatically and all-together. Basically this tech of mine handles A-Z of the management the patient and is available in any platform, starting from Facebook messenger, Google assistant, Slack, Skype etc and also if a person is trying to use our technology from a place which does not have internet the he or she can do so by using or calling facility and the procedure will be all same as it was in the other internet platforms.
